How to use the BitTrex Plugin:

Add to Accounts.csv
BitTrex,BitTrex,111111,111111,11111,AssetsFix,USD,1,1,BitTrex




- Add to the zorro.ini (need the header in bracket)
The PrivateKey and PublicKey values need to be taken from BitTrex.
DisplayCurrency is to show the balance in the selected currency, usually BTC, but can be different from base currency used for trading
BaseTradeCurrency is the base currency for trading. All traded pairs must have the selected BaseTradeCurrency 
on the right of the pair (ie: DASH/BTC if set to BTC)
IntervalSec is to set a cache time to avoid calling some API to many times
DemoTrading is to allow the Buy/Sell order not to be sent to the broker. Set it to 0 for live trading
EnableLog is to log to BitTrexPlugin.log file
UseCryptoCompareHistory is to download history from CryptoCompare instead of Bittrex
Min Order Size:  https://support.bittrex.com/hc/en-us/articles/202605394-Updates-to-Minimum-Trade-Sizes
Starting July 30th, we are standardizing our minimum trade sizes at 100,000 satoshis.  
API users will see the following error code when placing too small of an order. DUST_TRADE_DISALLOWED_MIN_VALUE_50K_SAT
I set a default value of 200K Satoshi in the config file, to keep the amount constant while trading.
This because as the exchange rate between coins and Bitcoin fluctuates, also would the min amount.
So I set this value only at the Zorro Start, and leave unchanged thereafter.
To be sure that there will be no min amount trading issue, just doubleing it up.
As Bittrex doesn't allow market orders, with LimitOrderMaxOrderBookDepth you can choose the max depth of the order book to allow the plugin to go for a limit order with a specific quantity.
If you want any order to be executed immediately just set it to a very high value. Fees in the asset list are based on this amount of 100k satoshi.
WaitAfterOrderForCheckSec id for defining the numbe of seconds to wait after order execution to retrieve the executed order details.

Knows Issues:

- Zorro Doesn't print/Show more than 5 decimals. So for some pairs you will see only 0. 
	For example if you trade DOGE/BTC, and have an account in BTC with balance of 0.0000010, zorro will show 0.
	Also in the Zorro log and Html report only 0s will be shown if values is outside of the 5 decimals.
- 1 minute History very limited. Option provided to use CryptoCompare history that is a bit longer.
- Sometimes you get Connection Timeout. The error shown in zorro is a parsing error, as the json parser can't parse the html page returned, you can get the html returned in the log file if enabled.
- Need the VC++ redistributable installed
- No leverage is supported by the plugin
- NFA flag must be set in the accounts.csv
- As BitTrex doesn't have demo accounts, limited testing has been done with real money
- Zorro 1 lot will have a different min amount depending on the pair that is set to the corresponding amount of 100k Satoshi. See the values in the zorro.ini
- Fees are 0.25% on BitTrex for each trade.
- Log file when enabled get big quickly. Use it for debug only or clean it often


Planned to do:
- Tool to download daily history from cryptocompare


Suggestions for zorro team:
Allow the number of displayed and logged decimals to be configurable in zorro.ini
